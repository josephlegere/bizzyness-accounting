# Bizzyness Accounting Service

> Bizzyness Accounting Service built using NuxtJS
> A Mix and Match Scalable ERP. Instead of bombarding every IT solutions out there to the consumers, we could instead provide them the very basic business need. As soon as they start to expand they are automatically going to be provided with a set of tools based on their business requirements in the current state of their company. Everything is going to run in the cloud, which means customers doesn't need to pay large amount of money for computing power, they only need to pay for the amount of activity happening on their system.
